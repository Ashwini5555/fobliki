A forum, blog, and wiki written in web.py that runs 
on google's AppEngine.

It is a simplification & generalization of the code 
that runs my site (overstimulate.com), as well as an
expansion to facility being more than a blog.

Think: crappy CMS by a ruby programmer trying to code
in python.  Ahh, now you know why you should go checkout
Django 1.0!
